## Project Euler Project 31: Coin Sums Tests

The "tests" here is one simple verification method. Considering the subject under test, the *ChangeMakerProblemSolver* tests, I inject a verification of the calculated total number of solutions, however, this is not really the point of testing a *Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver* such as this. It is more important that we achieve the reasonable set of responses; and again, if we wanted to maximize certain combinations of *U.K. Currency* denomination, we could do that as well, but this was not part of the original problem description. We simply wanted to determine the total number of possible combinations.
