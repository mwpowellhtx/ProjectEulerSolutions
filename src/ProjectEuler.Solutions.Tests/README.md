## Project Euler Project 31: Coin Sums Tests

The "tests" here is one simple verification method. Considering the subject under test, the [*ChangeMakerProblemSolver*](http://github.com/mwpowellhtx/ProjectEulerSolutions/blob/master/src/ProjectEuler.Solutions/Currency/UK/ChangeMakerProblemSolver.cs) tests, I inject a verification of the calculated total number of solutions, however, this is not really the point of testing a *Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver* such as this. It is more important that we achieve the reasonable set of responses; and again, if we wanted to maximize certain combinations of *U.K. Currency* denomination, we could do that as well, but this was not part of the original problem description. We simply wanted to determine the [total number of possible combinations](http://github.com/mwpowellhtx/ProjectEulerSolutions/blob/master/src/ProjectEuler.Solutions.Tests/Currency/UK/ChangeMakerProblemSolverTests.cs#L63).
